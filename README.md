# Emotion_DetectionV2
This is an optimized version of the previous Emotion_Detection project I worked on. This version uses Deep Learning to train a Dataset of facial expressions downloaded from Kaggle.
This is an optimized version of the previous Emotion_Detection project I worked on. This version uses Deep Learning to train a Dataset of facial expressions downloaded from Kaggle. The model trained model is then implemented with OpenCv in real time.
The notebook in this repo has the model trained through 30 epochs whose accuracy peaked at 42% but this was later increased to 600 and that increased accuracy to 64%
"emotion_det.h5" accuracy is 64% so you can implement in your own project

run pip install requirements.txt to install all dependencies used.
Just run sentiment_recognition.py to detect emotion in real time :)
